# Dart-exercises
These are my Dart exercises practicing the language. <br>
To launch them you have to create a [name].json with the following code:
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Dart & Flutter",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "program":"dart5.dart",
            "console":"terminal"
        }
    ]
}
