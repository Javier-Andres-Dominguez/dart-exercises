# Dart-exercises
These are my Dart exercises practicing the language. <br>
To launch them you have to create a [name].json with the following code:
{<br>
    "version": "0.2.0",<br>
    "configurations": [<br>
        {<br>
            "name": "Dart & Flutter",<br>
            "request": "launch",<br>
            "type": "dart",<br>
            "program":"dart5.dart",<br>
            "console":"terminal"<br>
        }<br>
    ]<br>
}
